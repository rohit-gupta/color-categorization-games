\begin_layout Abstract

Basic color term usage in natural languages has seen a great deal of research devoted to it in past decades. The reason is that the topic has served as a kind of battleground for rival philosophical standpoints regarding the nature of human language and cognition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

In this work, we explore the use of similarity-maximization signaling games to model the evolution of color categories. The model combines innate constraints in human color perception with cultural evolution driven by the need for communicative success. To put the model to a concrete test, we compare the outcome of our simulations directly to real-world basic color term usage data collected in the World Color Survey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

Although we do not find in our simulation results the same strong universal patterns that have been observed in natural languages, the level of agreement between our simulation results and real-world languages indicate that the model is on the right track to provide a good account of how basic color term usage can develop within a community.

 pioneered a long tradition of research into color term systems of world's languages. This broad typological study pointed out that there clearly are universal tendencies concerning repertoires of basic color terms in particular languages. The essential claim for our purposes is an evolutionary one: there is a cross-linguistically universal order in which color vocabularies are enriched by new terms. The order of emergence is captured by the following implicational hierarchy of universals: [white, black] 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 [red] 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 [green, yellow] 
\begin_inset Formula $<$

 [blue] 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 [brown] 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 [purple, pink, orange, gray]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This hierarchy expresses a complex constraint which was claimed to apply to all existing natural languages. It should be read as follows: if a language has a well-established term for red (that is, a term covering the point of the color space which is the prototypical denotation of the English 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

red
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), it also has basic terms for white and for black, but not necessarily 
\shape italic
vice versa
\shape default
. Similarly, if it has one for green or for yellow, it also has one for red, and so on. According to this picture, color term systems are far from being relativistically arbitrary: whatever number of terms they contain, these terms can carve the color space only in certain ways. For example, in a language with three color terms, these are bound to cover, respectively, red, black, and white. The English terms are in fact misleading, since each language is supposed to fully partition the color space. In the last case, the term for red is likely to cover violet or orange as well and the other two terms would rather correspond to

; in Stage III (4 basic color terms) there are the types [W; R; Y; Bk+G+Bu], [W, R+Y, G+Bu, Bk] and [W, R, Y+G+Bu; Bk]. The authors note that there are five possible evolutionary trajectories between stages I to V, assuming that any evolutionary step consists in splitting the denotation (the covered focal points) of one term of the previous system in two.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The way the empirical results are presented requires some discussion. The talk of evolutionary paths as instantiated by the languages is slightly misleading: what was really observed was in each case a snapshot of a color term system belonging to one of the 9 types, or to a transition between two of them. These observed transitions are the maximum of diachrony captured in the WCS; apart from this we cannot infer anything about how a particular observed color vocabulary actually came about. This having been clarified, the formulation in terms of these emergence trajectories and the representation of the particular types seems more appropriate than the original strong formulation in terms of implicational hierarchy. First, it draws attention to the almost universal

 principle of partitioning the color space by the available terms, and consequently to the fact that if a color vocabulary is enriched with an additional term, the denotation of some or all of the already established terms is likely to be modified. Second, the gathered data do not seem univocal enough to formulate an implicational hierarchy as strong as that of Berlin and Kay

particular

 generalizations (implicative or other) are valid is an altogether different question. We conjecture that a consequential part of the original hierarchy would not find a significant support in the data, since in the sample there are relatively little languages spread among the types with 4 or less basic color terms, as opposed to about 80 languages with 5 or 6 basic color terms or in between.

In the general lack of statistically conclusive support for individual universal features of human color categorization, we will focus on the two of them that can be most reliably inferred from the absolute numbers reported by Kay and Maffi

. One is that vocabularies with 3 basic color terms tend to partition the color space according to the scheme [W; R+Y; Bk+G+Bu], that is, to separate the warm colors while keeping the cool colors together with black. This is the only reported type for Stage II, instantiated by 6 languages. The other universal feature to focus on is the evolutionarily late division of green and blue: [W; R; Y, G+Bu; Bk] is by far the most represented type of systems with 5 basic terms (Stage IV), instantiated by 41 languages. The strong universal tendencies to carve up the color space in the described way when, respectively, three and five basic color terms are present, will be in the following regarded as the strongest, best substantiated empirical facts to be explained.

The human JND is a psychophysiologically determined function which for any given wavelength from the extent of the visible spectrum gives the minimal difference in wavelength of two hues that are distinguishable by the human eye in that particular region of the spectrum. This function is implemented as a constraint on cultural interaction of artificial agents, conceived roughly along the lines of Steels and Belpaeme's

It shows only that categorical systems developed via cultural interaction constrained by the human JND are less dispersed across populations than when a flat, non-human JND is used. The only quantitative agreement, then, is between the ratio of the two respective values of dispersion, and the dispersion ratio of the actually observed categorical systems of the WCS, compared to a specific randomization of these (as done by Kay and Regier

%both these values are construed in such a complicated fashion that proper interpretation of the match can hardly be straightforward. RO: I insist upon this, though it may not sound as a correct argument. The thing is that evolution in silica, according to a specific dynamic, is something quite different and trasparent in comparison with the overall evolution of world's languages with the immense number of participating factors (including genetic relations, language contact, wars and whatever). While in some respects the artificial dynamic may be almost reasonable model for the latter, I'm pretty sure that from an out-of-the-blue coincidence of two similarly constructed numbers describing outcomes of these two processes absolutely nothing can be inferred.

The human JND as a constraint on routine language interaction over empirical input is sufficient for them to derive a hierarchy of color terms according to the time it takes for color terms in various regions of the visible spectrum to be agreed upon within the population.

. Let us discuss the relevance of this finding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

First, there seems to be a methodological problem with choice of color terms and their matching to regions of the spectrum. This should, arguably, have been done either by selecting a set of cross-linguistically basic colors and locating them in the spectrum, or by selecting important points or sections of the JND function and reading off the respective colors; but an opaque combination of both seems to have taken place. In the first case we would expect both green and yellow in the selection, instead of green/yellow, and we might challenge the inclusion of cyan and (magenta)-red. In the second case, while most of the selected points reflect peaks and valleys of the function, (magenta)-red does not, violet and red are disputable, and there is an unreflected valley between violet and blue. Some of this could be actually resolved in favor of the parallel between the achieved hierarchy and Berlin and Kay's hierarchy; first of all, there are reasons to pick only red for the experiment, instead of red, (magenta)-red and violet. But there remains the problem that green/yellow in the achieved hierarchy is a single transitional color, while in Berlin and Kay's hierarchy green and yellow are two distinct colors occupying the same position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Moreover, let us remember that the work by Berlin and Kay
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is a dated reference and there is little point in evaluating explanatory proposals concerning universals of color categorization against the hierarchy stated there, in presence of the WCS data, the superiority of which is both empirical and methodological. Our discussion in Section

 and the cross-linguistic reality would have been magnified by an up-to-date evaluation, rather than attenuated. While we believe that the features of human perception that are captured by the JND function should play an important explanatory role regarding linguistic universals, we believe a more up-to-date investigation is still necessary.

, is a more general version of that. Instead of carving up a physically defined space (one-dimensional in the previous case), they consider partitions of the psychologically relevant, 3D color space CIELAB. This color space is designed so that standard Euclidean distance of two hues corresponds to their psychological dissimilarity. By using this color space, the constraint on human color perception embodied by the JND is encompassed rather than discarded as a source of explanation, for what it expresses has to be involved also in construction of any psychologically relevant space. When the Munsell color palette used in the WCS is projected into the CIELAB space, its chips mark the surface of an irregular sphere. What is then discussed are partitions of the set of color points thus arranged. The authors convincingly show a strong preference of the WCS languages for efficient partitions, efficient in terms of maximizing the compactness of their color categories in the CIELAB space. What this means is that the closer two chips are in the perceptual space, the more likely they will be lumped under the same color term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This is clearly an important result, pointing to optimality as an essential factor of color categorization. However, this line can be drawn further. Given the specific way of evaluation (each language's actual partition vs.
\begin_inset space \space{}

\end_inset

its various rotations around the sphere), the results cannot directly account for any particular linguistic universal in question. For instance, we do not see whether the most efficient ways of partitioning the figure into 5 regions involve keeping blue and green together. Another issue is that optimality or efficiency is a static feature of a categorical system (of an individual speaker or of a language 
\shape italic

), without it being clear how it might have come about. In our approach we adopt the idea of the overall character of human visual perception, reflected in the CIELAB color space, as the likely source of universals of color categorization. For sake of comparability with the WCS data we also work with the projected Munsell palette. However, the optimization strategy used by Regier et al.

 construe the problem as a similarity-maximization signaling game. Nature picks a point from the color space as the meaning to be conveyed; the sender sends one term from a finite set to signal the chosen meaning to the receiver; the receiver interprets the received signal by choosing a point from the color space. The payoff this signaling action brings to both the sender and the receiver is a monotonically decreasing function of the distance in the color space between the receiver's interpretation and the speaker's intended meaning. In general, the sender strategy is a function from the set of points of the color space to (a probabilistic distribution over) the given set of terms, and the receiver strategy is a function from the set of terms to (a probabilistic distribution over) the set of points of the color space.

This process can be, in principle, viewed as a model of evolution of color categories in a community. How various parameters of such a model are to be set up is, of course, subject to discussion.

. In the former setting, categories are inherently linguistic and can be unproblematically called

concepts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as well. The latter approach, on the other hand, makes the conceptual distinction between perceptual and linguistic categories. Each agent, based on empirical input, individually divides a continuous perceptual space into regions (perceptual categories) within which she cannot further distinguish. A linguistic category then emerges through subsuming of adjacent perceptual categories under a single term. As perceptual categorization independent of language seems to be a problematic notion to us, we prefer the simpler formulation in terms of signaling games. Admittedly, we consider only the 330 Munsell chips as the color space, instead of the continuous space. This choice is motivated by simplicity, especially for allowing a more direct evaluation against the WCS data, but it can be seen as a preliminary perceptual categorization of the continuous space. However, a difference is that in our case the perceptual space is not carved up arbitrarily by individual agents, but uniformly and in roughly homogeneous way with respect to human resolution abilities.

Regarding game dynamics, we used the replicator equation over mixed strategies. A sender strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in T\rightarrow\Delta\left(M\right)$

 associates to each point in the perceptual space a probability distribution over the set of messages. A receiver strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\in M\rightarrow\Delta\left(T\right)$
\end_inset

 associates to each message a probability distribution over all points in perceptual space. Probability values should be interpreted as percentages of a hypothetical population. Therefore, if

, we calculated a mode map per language in the WCS data. Each language was then classified regarding the number of main color terms. Since Regier et al.
\begin_inset space \space{}

\end_inset

did not provide a clear criterion for what they consider a main color term, we employed our own heuristic: we counted for each language how many color terms cover at least

-term languages (or simulation results) 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 by mapping terms in one language to terms in the other. The procedure was to establish the mapping based on the amount of overlap between terms as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Calculate, for each pair of terms 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}\in L_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}\in L_{2}$
\end_inset

, the number of chips they have in common;

Establish a one-to-one mapping starting with the two terms that have the highest overlap until no more terms are left or no overlap exists between the remaining terms.

 and what percentage of

. The overall quality of the mapping can be calculated in terms of accuracy, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space \space{}

\end_inset

what percentage of total overlap is there with the established mapping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The accuracy numbers can then be summarized to give an impression of the overall match between our languages (or simulation results) and the languages in the WCS. As reference points for comparison we calculated these numbers not only for our simulation results but for three other scenarios, namely: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Matching each WCS language against its peers (in number of main color terms). This establishes a pragmatic upper bound to how well we can expect a simulation to be able to perform; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Simulation results performed with a neutral similarity metric. Since the Munsell chips are distributed in CIELAB space as an irregular sphere, for these results we laid them out as a regular sphere. For that we used as spherical coordinates, value to indicate the elevation angle, hue to indicate the azimuth angle, and a fixed radius estimated from the irregular sphere. Distance was then computed by converting these coordinates to Cartesian coordinates and calculating the Euclidean distance; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Random assignment of color terms to chips (basically the initial conditions of the simulation). This establishes a lower bound for comparison.

In our stage IV, the most represented types are [W; Y+Bk; G; Bu; R], [W; Y; G; R+Bu; Bk] and [W; Y; R; G+Bk; Bu].

It is nonetheless important to note that the reported numbers crucially depend on the considered position of the focal points, and that a slight change in this respect can substantially modify the resulting picture. The position of focal blue is a most striking example. In our classification there are 
\begin_inset Formula $19$
\end_inset

 systems in which focal blue and red are subsumed under a common term. However, if we regarded the chip F28 instead of the neighbouring F29 as the focal blue, 
\begin_inset Formula $17$

In the following, we evaluate our model as to its general predictive power with respect to the documented languages of the WCS. In this part of evaluation, all 330 chips are treated equally and the question of focal colors plays no role.

General quantitative evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We established mappings between each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $60$
\end_inset

 outcomes of the simulations and the languages in the WCS in the respective categories. For example, for 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 terms we have 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 simulations matched against 
\begin_inset Formula $12$
\end_inset

 languages, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $120$
\end_inset

 accuracy values. Table

What the numbers indicate is that the simulations are approximating the phenomenon, although in a limited way. As expected, the accuracy values obtained by the simulation results are significantly higher than those obtained by random assignment. However, they are also significantly lower than the within-category accuracy values obtained by the languages in the WCS, albeit closer to this scenario than to the random one. The comparison with the perfect sphere scenario shows how important the topology of the color space is: the accuracy values for this scenario are quite close to the ones obtained by the simulation results. However, they are also consistently lower, which indicates that our simulation setup is capturing some other non-trivial characteristics of the phenomenon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Unfortunately, due to time limitations, we were not able to perform a more in-depth analysis of all the results. This is important future work to identify weaknesses in the model and therefore explore improvements to it. For example, we noticed that the distribution of the accuracy values of the simulations for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 is actually bi-modal: 5 simulations have accuracy values ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.394$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.615$
\end_inset

, with an average of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.474$
\end_inset

, whereas the other 5 have accuracy values ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.588$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.788$
\end_inset

, with an average of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.691$
\end_inset

. This indicates that a large number of populations are getting stuck in some local minimum and thus adding for example mutation and/or invention to the model might give a big boost in overall performance.

, the overall quantitative evaluation of the model is encouraging, especially if you consider the best-case values achieved. We have shown that a very simple similarity-maximization signaling game based on a realistic color space can already approximate, even if slightly, real-world basic color term usage. Furthermore, our result is in certain sense complementary to that of Regier et al.

. Whereas their work establishes the inclination of the WCS categorical systems to optimality, taking the projection of the Munsell chips into the CIELAB space for granted, our model confirms that there is indeed a degree of realism in choosing just this projection to be partitioned. We would now like to discuss a number of limitations of the model where there is room for improvement by future research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

First, we have largely neglected empiricist views on the nature of categories, emphasizing the dependence of these on the character of the empirical input of any individual. We did so in assuming flat probabilistic distribution over the perceptual space of 330 points. Instead, a more realistic distribution could be used which would reflect distribution of colors in natural sceneries. Purely empiricist strategies of deriving color categories, based on clustering of such realistically distributed input, are assessed by Yendrikhovskij

. The latter show that realistic distribution helps a population of agents to converge in their categorical repertoires, but is not a sufficiently strong factor to establish a full agreement. In our model, convergence is reached via linguistic interaction anyway, and realistic color distribution might increase the performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This suggestion, though, embodies a rather crude version of empiricism. It would be even more desirable to integrate in the model ecological significances of various colors found in the environment, which need not correspond to overall representation of these colors in one's visual field. For instance, it seems plausible that red, the color of blood and of many ripe fruits, is a more important color to be linguistically distinguished than, say, purple or turquoise, or even blue of clear sky and green of vegetation. If grounded in independent evidence, rather than mere speculation, this could be represented in our model by a utility function differentiated over the perceptual space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Second, our model is clearly unrealistic in that it lets fixed numbers of terms compete in the perceptual space equally from a random start. Instead, we should let terms break into the space already partitioned by previous ones, as is apparently the case in language evolution. This might lead to categorical systems quite different from what we got in our setting. Allowing new signals to be invented is not unusual in signaling games and besides being more realistic it can even help achieving convergence faster and avoiding certain undesirable equilibria

Third, for reasons of simplicity we used the set of Munsell chips projected in the CIELAB color space as the perceptual space for the game. However, what would be more realistic would be to use the continuous CIELAB space and only for purposes of evaluation against the WCS map the results back to the set of Munsell chips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Finally, CIELAB is not the most up-to-date color appearance model and has recently been superseded by CIECAM02
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

. We used the CIELAB coordinates since those were conveniently provided with the WCS data, but perhaps using CIECAM02 instead could lead to even better results.

\begin_layout Section

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Our contribution is a model which transparently embodies a small amount of explanatory principles, and a method of refined evaluation, which can be repeated for future models of the same phenomenon. We did not fully succeed in obtaining the results we expected, but we got some promising indicators that the model is on the right track. We provided a number of suggestions for improvements and we believe that, with those in place, the model could provide a very realistic account of how certain quasi-universal patterns of basic color term usage can arise.
